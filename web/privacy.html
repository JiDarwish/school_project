                    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>

                    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law and the concepts they include
                        have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
                        the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
                        with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

                    <p>in order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,

                    <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally
                        pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
                        principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                        that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
                        by data processors.</p>

                    recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for
                    violations.

                    <h3>We collect your email address in order to: </h3>
                    <p>• Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</p>
